    Abigail and Madeline are now in year two of elementary school and have been
    developing their mathematical knowledge.  They are pretty good at counting,
    but still struggle with writing numbers [^1].  They know the digits `1`,
    `2`, `3`, and `4` pretty well.  Unfortunately, they sometimes don't realize
    `4` is different from `1`, so they think that `4` is just another way to
    write `1`.[^2]

    To practice their number writing, Abigail and Madeline play a little game
    where they makes numbers with the four digits they know and sums the values.
    For example:

        :::text
        132     = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
        112314  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9     # Remember that 4 = 1

    Abigail and Madeline now want to know how many such numbers can they create
    whose sum is a number `n`. For `n = 2`, they can make `5` numbers:

        :::text
        11, 14, 41, 44, 2

    For `n > 2`, they are having trouble forming the numbers, so Abigail and
    Madeline need your help.

    [^1]:   Like father, like daughters.
    [^2]:   Not true, but I needed a story.

    ## Input

    The input will consist of an arbitrary number of integers `n` such that `1 <=
    n <= 1000`.

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        2
        3

    ## Output

    For each integer read, output an single integer stating how many numbers
    Abigail and Madeline can make such that the sum of the digits is equal to
    `n`.

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        5
        13

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 01]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-34872-su20-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git checkout master                       # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitLab

        $ git checkout -b challenge10               # Create and checkout challenge10 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge10/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge10/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "challenge10: done"         # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge10            # Send changes to GitLab

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/submit.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/submit.py
        Submitting challenge10 assignment ...
        Submitting challenge10 code ...
          Result Success
           Score 6.00
            Time 0.02

        $ curl -F source=@challenge10/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-34872-su20/challenge10
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.016405344009399414}
